Hello there!

You`re about to test the tech challenge built by myself.
Please, follow these steps:
1 - Run the API first. It is implemented using maven, so you know how to make it...
2 - After running the api, please go to app and run the famouns "ne serve". It'll take a few moments and you can open your preferred browser and access the http://localhost:4200
It'll bring you the upload page.
3 - Select a CNAB file, click "Upload" button and see the magic happens.

You can, obviously, choose another method to test, for example, the postman one.
So, if you go by this way...
1 - Run the API
2 - Open the postman or similar and point it to the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:9001/CNABFileUpload
2.1 - Important! You need to use POST to send the file, ok?
3 - You`ll need to set the form data, setting 'cnabFile' as paramenter name and choosing the file you want to upload.
4 - Send it
5 - Wait for the response
6 - If the file is valid, please, open a new tab, point to the http://127.0.0.1:9001/cnabFile as a GET request.
7 - See the magic...
